    "# Finding k-mers \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the term k-mer to indicate a string of DNA of length *k*. You can think of them loosely as words within a DNA sequence. For example:\n",
    "> 'ATCG' is a 4-mer (k-mer of length 4)\n",
    "> 'ATTGGGCT' is a 8-mer (kmer of length 8)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think about it: How many 2-mers of DNA are there? How many 8-mers? What is the general formula for calculating the number of possible kmers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "k-mers of various lengths are used across biology to facilitate the analysis of sequence information. For example, k-mers are used for:\n",
    "1. The assembly of genomes and transcriptomes through the construction of De Bruijn graphs (more on this later)\n",
    "2. Identify protein coding regions\n",
    "3. Identify species within metagenomes \n",
    "4. Detection of repeats and transposable elements\n",
    "5. Evidence of recombination\n",
    "6. Identifying contamination or misassembly\n",
    "\n",
    "And many more! We will talk about k-mers more in future but for today-- let's just think about how to find them and count them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often, sequences are broken down into their component k-mers. For example: \n",

    "```\n",

    "First, let's write a function called `PatternCount` that counts the number of times a pattern occurs in a string.

You should then count the number of times a pattern occurs and return and print that number.  \n",
